<!-- action sends to another form, method can be 2 things: post sends to a server on the backend. 2 is get, it is insecure. should be only things you will see on the url. not usernames and passwords 

post methods won't work on the place we are going to upload, only get-->

It's about understanding, not remembering

a long class name because things like column is so common you don't know which one... so status_bar__column which includes father and child is much better

___________________________________________________
can just use classes for everything instead of keep checking if something is a #class or and .id

block component
.btn {}

Element that depends upon the block
.btn__price {}

Modifier that changes the style of the block
.btn--orange {}
,btn--big {}

^^ used to use this but hard to understand why for beginners because they haven't "suffered" yet to know they need this
so instead use like this>>>>
<a class="btn btn--big btn--orange" href="https://css-tricks.com">
    <span class="btn__price">$9.99</span>
    <span class="btn__text">Subscribe</span>
</a>

This makes reading the code way easier

We knew we were going to have a few headers so we made classes, but for form, we are only going to have one so it's simple




When you add padding to a box, css tries to help you because the padding leaves less space for the content that is inside so it makes the box bigger
example: You made 200px wide box then added 50px padding leaves 150 pixel width for the content. SO it adds 50px that you asked for to the box, essentially making it a 250 width
but now you have a bigger box........

WHEN I SAY box-padding: border-box; IT DOESN'T MODIFY THE TOTAL SIZE.
